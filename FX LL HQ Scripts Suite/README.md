## ABOUT FX LL HQ Scripts Suite

This scripts suite aims to deliver convenient way to manage effects in Reaper project, specifically their low latency and high quality modes.
Big part of this script is ak5k's extension 'ReaLlm'. Thanks to it's open API user can customize it's settings directly from the script.

Besides managing ReaLlm's settings, user can create database files that includes all effects with defined parameters that should be switched instead of bypassed.

This database can be also triggered by two other scripts in this suite manually.
